                Simulacra Sound is a revolutionary product line of genre-oriented Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) designed
                with interface simplicity in mind. Unlike catch-all DAWs with overwhelming options, our DAWs are carefully
                crafted to empower you in creating music quickly and effectively, free from the distractions of conventional
                software. Just like analog mixers and instruments, our tactile interfaces keep you focused and seamlessly
                integrated into your creative environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cosmo 388 is the first DAW from Simulacra Sound. This fully functional workstation is designed to replicate
                the legendary Tascam 388 reel-to-reel tape machine. With its 8 channels for recording and playback, animated
                VU meters, and lifelike reel-to-reel movement, Cosmo 388 immerses you in the world of authentic analog
                recording.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through advanced convolution techniques, this powerful DAW faithfully captures the warmth, saturation, and
                dynamic response of an analog tape machine. As you play, record, and mix your music, Cosmo 388 reacts
                dynamically to your input signal's amplitude, just like a genuine tape machine would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Designed with simplicity in mind, Cosmo 388 is a perfect choice for musicians at any level. Whether you're a
                beginner, intimidated by the complexities of professional DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic, or Ableton, or a
                seasoned musician seeking a streamlined workflow, Cosmo 388 delivers a user-friendly interface that empowers
                you to quickly record and produce your music.
              </p>
              <p>
                With two dedicated send dials for Reverb and Tape Saturation, Cosmo 388 offers effortless control over the
                depth and character of your sound. The immersive, out-of-the-box experience ensures that your recordings sound
                incredible from the moment you hit the play button.

              The Universal Clavier is my Portland State University Thesis project. Using MaxMsp and Java, I've created a generative audio piece that turns live data tracking from 10 asteroids, ocean buoys, South American earthquakes, air quality and weather from around the country into real time music inspired by Baroque musicians. 


            </p>
            <p>
             
             As the clock ticks and the day unfolds, the Universal Clavier dynamically adjusts its musical scales and key, seamlessly harmonizing with the passage of time. It's like the soundtrack of the world adapting to the rhythm of the day. In a 24hr cycle, the internal logic of the program creates an ever evolving symphony that resonates with the pulse of our planet.

            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing the power of Jitter, the visuals presented in the accompanying video are also generated in real time, derived from the captured data itself. This remarkable fusion of audio and visual elements creates a captivating audio-visual synesthesia, where sound and sight dance together in perfect harmony.

            </p>
            <p>
              The Universal Clavier is an embodiment of the possibilities that arise when music and data intertwine, allowing us to perceive our world through a new lens.
